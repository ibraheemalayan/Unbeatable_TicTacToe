X plans 

: starting at corner

    :: he plays center:
        you can do two: 

        a. play on the opposite corner

            i = 8 if p = 0
            i = 2 if p = 6
            i = 0 if p = 8
            i = 2 if p = 6

               if he plays any corner you won with must moves

               if he plays any edge you reach to a tie with must moves and randoms
        
        b. play on far edge of your corner

                if he plays : 
                    
                    - p opposite corner or near corner , it's draw with randoms and must moves

                    - far corner, you win with must moves

                    - near ot edge, you put in bt corner and win with must moves

                    - near bt edge, you do one must move then 
                        - if he plays near edge ot you put on p opposite corner and win with must moves

                        - if he plays corner (near your second move and not opposite to your p) you win with must moves
                        
                        else its draw with must moves and randoms
                    
                    else its draw with must moves, no randoms
    

    :: he plays corner:
        
        you play only corners until you win with must moves

    :: he plays far edge 
        
        you play the corner not near him and wou win with must moves

    :: he plays near edge

        you play center then any the edge near your first step and win with must moves 
        or
        you play the not opposite corner that there is a free square between it and you then play center and win with must moves
